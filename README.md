# :earth_americas: Welcome to Java! :coffee:

Java is a high level, modern programming language created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, and currently owned by Oracle.

Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!

Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application.

Java has a huge developer community.
