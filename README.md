# :earth_americas: Welcome to Java! :coffee:

`Java is a high level`, modern programming language created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, and currently owned by Oracle and more than `3 billion` devices run Java.

Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!

Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application.

Java has a huge developer community.

## It is used for:

- Mobile applications _(specially Android apps)_
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection
- And much, much more!

## Why Use Java?

- Java works on different platforms _(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)_
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast and powerful
- It has a huge community support _(tens of millions of developers)_
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
