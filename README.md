# :earth_americas: Welcome to Java! :coffee:

`Java is a high level`, modern programming language created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, and currently owned by Oracle and more than `3 billion` devices run Java.

Java is Platform Independent, which means that you only need to write the program once to be able to run it on a number of different platforms!

Java is portable, robust, and dynamic, with the ability to fit the needs of virtually any type of application.

Java has a huge developer community.

## It is used for:

- Mobile applications _(specially Android apps)_
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connection
- And much, much more!

## Why Use Java?

- Java works on different platforms _(Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)_.
- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.
- It is easy to learn and simple to use.
- It is open-source and free.
- It is secure, fast and powerful.
- It has a huge community support _(tens of millions of developers)_.
- Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.

## Java Getting Started

Some PCs might have Java already installed.

To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):

C:\Users\Your Name>java -version

//My Mac environment

- openjdk version "11.0.10" 2021-01-19
- OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.10+9)
- OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.10+9, mixed mode)
  // - $ exit -> [Process completed]
